# Week 4 assignment:

## graphs for each variable:

Mention: Since all my variables are floating numbers, mode number does not make sense.

### diameter:

In terms of diameter, we can observe that most crater are some size ones. The median and the mean of this variable is 0.1 km and 2.29 km respectively.



### depth:

The mean and median of this variable is 0.15 km and 0.1 km respectively.



Based on figures above, we can observer that the majority of craters are small ones, which is the case.

### latitude and longitude:

We can see from the picture below, craters are spread kind of evenly.
