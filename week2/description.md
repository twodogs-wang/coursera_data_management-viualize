# Description:

## longitude & latitude: 

based on the frequency distribution of these two variables. It is easy to find out that the area around (-53,-23) has much more craters than others.

## DIAM_CIRCLE_IMAGE:

it could be observed that most craters are about 1.0 diameter size.

## DEPTH:

most depth values are 0 which are not likely. It must be values are missed.

## Summary:

As data shown above, the craters are spread evenly. However, we still can find that there is an area with high density. In addition, we could find that most craters are small sizes. Which is the case. We could introduce some new variables like "size" for example for further analysis.
